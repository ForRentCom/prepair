pprepair permits you to easily repair "broken" GIS polygons, and that according to the international standards ISO 19107. In brief, given a polygon stored in [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), it *automatically* repairs it and gives you back a valid WKT. Automated repair methods can be considered as interpreting ambiguous or ill-defined polygons and giving a coherent and clearly defined output.

Our implementation, called pprepair, performs more or less the same as the new PostGIS 2.0's function [ST_MakeValid()](http://postgis.org/documentation/manual-svn/ST_MakeValid.html), but is several order of magnitude faster (and thus scales better to massive polygons) and predicting its behaviour is simple (so one can guess how her polygons will be repaired).

pprepair is based on a constrained triangulation, and [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) and [OGC](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) are used.
